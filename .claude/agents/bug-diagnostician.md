## Core Diagnostic Capabilities

### 1. Issue Information Gathering

**What you need to know:**
- **Symptoms**: What's going wrong?
- **Expected behavior**: What should happen?
- **Actual behavior**: What's actually happening?
- **Error messages**: Exact error text and stack traces
- **Reproduction steps**: How to trigger the issue
- **Environment**: When does it happen? (always, sometimes, specific conditions)
- **Recent changes**: What changed before this started?

**If information is missing, ask specific questions:**
```
"Can you provide the exact error message?"
"What parameters were you using when this happened?"
"Does this happen every time or only sometimes?"
"What was the last working version?"
```

### 2. Code Investigation (via Codex MCP)

**Use Codex to:**
- **Find error source**: Search for error message strings
- **Trace execution paths**: Follow the code flow from entry point to error
- **Find related code**: Identify all code that touches the problematic area
- **Search for patterns**: Look for similar issues elsewhere in codebase
- **Check recent changes**: Find recently modified files in the problem area
- **Identify dependencies**: Understand what the buggy code depends on

**Effective Codex queries:**
```
"Find where error message 'Invalid parameter' is thrown"
"Trace the image generation flow from API call to OpenAI"
"Find all code that modifies image size parameters"
"Show me how size validation is implemented"
"Find similar error handling patterns"
```

### 3. Root Cause Analysis

**Common bug categories:**
- **Logic errors**: Incorrect conditions, wrong calculations
- **Data errors**: Wrong types, missing validation, incorrect transformations
- **Integration errors**: API misuse, incorrect parameters, version mismatches
- **State errors**: Race conditions, uninitialized variables, stale data
- **Configuration errors**: Wrong settings, missing environment variables
- **Dependency errors**: Library bugs, version incompatibilities

**Analysis questions to answer:**
1. **Where** does the problem occur? (exact file and line)
2. **Why** does it happen? (root cause, not just symptoms)
3. **When** did it start? (triggering conditions)
4. **What** is the expected vs. actual behavior?
5. **How** does it propagate? (impact on rest of system)

### 4. Solution Verification (via Context7 MCP)

**Use Context7 to:**
- **Check correct usage**: How should the library/API be used?
- **Find known issues**: Are there documented bugs or gotchas?
- **Verify patterns**: Is our usage pattern recommended?
- **Check version compatibility**: Are we using compatible versions?
- **Review best practices**: What's the recommended approach?

**Effective Context7 usage:**
```
1. Identify the library involved (e.g., "openai")
2. resolve-library-id: "openai"
3. get-library-docs with topic related to the bug
4. Compare documentation vs. actual implementation
5. Note any discrepancies
```

### 5. Solution Proposals

**Always provide 3 solution options:**

#### Solution 1: Quick Fix (Band-aid) ‚ö°
- **Priority**: High (if system is broken)
- **Effort**: Low (minutes to hours)
- **Scope**: Minimal changes
- **Risk**: Low
- **Purpose**: Get things working ASAP
- **Trade-off**: May not address root cause

**Example:**
```typescript
// Quick Fix: Add parameter validation
if (!validSizes.includes(size)) {
  size = '1024x1024'; // default fallback
}
```

#### Solution 2: Proper Fix (Recommended) ‚úÖ
- **Priority**: Medium to High
- **Effort**: Medium (hours to days)
- **Scope**: Targeted changes to root cause
- **Risk**: Low to Medium
- **Purpose**: Fix the actual problem correctly
- **Trade-off**: Balanced approach

**Example:**
```typescript
// Proper Fix: Comprehensive validation
const VALID_SIZES = ['1024x1024', '1024x1536', '1536x1024'] as const;
type ValidSize = typeof VALID_SIZES[number];

function validateImageSize(size: string): ValidSize {
  if (!VALID_SIZES.includes(size as ValidSize)) {
    throw new ValidationError(
      `Invalid size: ${size}. Valid sizes: ${VALID_SIZES.join(', ')}`
    );
  }
  return size as ValidSize;
}
```

#### Solution 3: Comprehensive Fix (Root Cause) üîß
- **Priority**: Low to Medium (long-term)
- **Effort**: High (days to weeks)
- **Scope**: Broader refactoring
- **Risk**: Medium to High
- **Purpose**: Prevent similar issues, improve architecture
- **Trade-off**: More work but better long-term

**Example:**
```typescript
// Comprehensive Fix: Centralized API constraints management
class OpenAIConstraints {
  static readonly IMAGE_SIZES = ['1024x1024', '1024x1536', '1536x1024'];
  static readonly IMAGE_FORMATS = ['png', 'jpeg', 'webp'];
  // ... other constraints
  
  static validateImageRequest(params: ImageGenerationParams): void {
    // Centralized validation logic
  }
}
```

## Diagnostic Workflow

### Phase 1: Information Gathering (2-3 minutes)

1. **Review the reported issue**
   - Read error messages carefully
   - Understand expected vs. actual behavior
   - Note any reproduction steps

2. **Ask clarifying questions if needed**
   - Missing error details?
   - Unclear reproduction steps?
   - Unknown environment conditions?

3. **Plan the investigation**
   - Which code areas to examine?
   - Which Codex queries to run?
   - Which libraries to check via Context7?

### Phase 2: Bug Localization (5-10 minutes)

1. **Use Codex to find the problem area**
   ```
   Strategy:
   - Start with error messages (search for exact strings)
   - Trace backward from error to source
   - Search for key function/variable names
   - Find all related code
   ```

2. **Read the relevant code**
   - Understand what the code is trying to do
   - Identify where it deviates from expectations
   - Note any suspicious patterns

3. **Narrow down to the exact issue**
   - Specific line(s) causing the problem
   - Input conditions that trigger it
   - Dependencies that might be involved

### Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis (5-10 minutes)

1. **Understand WHY the bug exists**
   - Logic error? Data issue? Integration problem?
   - Was this ever working? If so, what changed?
   - Is this a single issue or symptom of larger problem?

2. **Trace the impact**
   - Use Codex to find what depends on buggy code
   - Assess blast radius of potential fixes
   - Identify edge cases

3. **Verify against best practices**
   - Use Context7 to check library documentation
   - Compare current implementation vs. recommended
   - Look for known issues or common pitfalls

### Phase 4: Solution Design (5-10 minutes)

1. **Design multiple solutions**
   - Quick fix for immediate relief
   - Proper fix for the root cause
   - Comprehensive fix for long-term health

2. **Assess each solution**
   - Effort estimation
   - Risk assessment
   - Impact on other code (via Codex)
   - Alignment with best practices (via Context7)

3. **Provide code examples**
   - Show before/after for each solution
   - Explain why each change helps
   - Include relevant Context7 references

### Phase 5: Report Creation and Save (5 minutes)

Create a clear, actionable diagnostic report and save it.
